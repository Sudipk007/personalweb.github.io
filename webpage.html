                    <b>Hi there! </b>I’m Sudip Karki, a passionate computer science graduate with an associate degree, continuously pushing boundaries in the tech world and beyond. My journey began with an early fascination for technology, and over the years, I’ve cultivated a deep interest in coding, problem-solving, and self-improvement.
                    <br>
                   <b> Future Goals</b>
As I look ahead, I’m planning to continue expanding my knowledge in full-stack development, cloud computing, and AI. I aim to build more meaningful projects that can solve real-world problems, whether it's through innovative software or impactful social media content.

I’m always eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals, whether it’s for tech projects, fitness journeys, or personal growth conversations. Let’s connect and create something amazing together!
